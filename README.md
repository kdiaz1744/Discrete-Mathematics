## Discrete-Mathematics
Final project and every assignment I did in this class

#Assignment 1:
Assume that a set of ‚Äún‚Äù elements is represented as an array, write a program to represent the set operations:

‚Ä¢ X n Y

‚Ä¢ X ‚Äì Y

‚Ä¢ X ‚ñ≤ Y


#Assignment 2:
Given the following function: (ùëé) ùë¶ = ùë• 2, (ùëè) ùë¶ = 2 ùë•, (ùëê) ùë¶ = ùë• 3 ‚àí 2ùë• 2 ‚àí 5ùë• + 6, (ùëë) ùë¶ = ùë• 3
Prove that:

Item (a) is not 1-1 and not onto. (b) is 1-1 but not onto. (c) is not 1-1 but it is onto and (d) is 1-1 and onto
For each one makes the following:

(a) Input a set of values for X (by keyboard)

(b) Print the set of values of Y

(c) Test if is onto, 1-1, Output the result


#Assignment 3: 
Let A= {1,2,3,4}, B={5,6,7} C={8,9,10,11} and f: A‚ÜíB g: B‚ÜíC a) Form the function f and g b) Find (gof) c) Find (fog)

#Assignment 4:
Run the pseudo code:

sum = 0;

i= n;

while i > 0

sum = sum+1

i = floor(i/2);

end

Let the time complexity function f (n) to be the number of times the statement sum:= sum +1 is executed. Determine the best ‚Äúbig Oh‚Äù form for f (n) . Note, floor() round the number to lower integer. Try using log2 ( )


#Assignment 5:
A bank pay 6% annual interest on saving, compounding the interest monthly. If we deposit $1000 on the first day of May, how much will this deposit be worth a year later? Write a program to solve the above problem. Use two versions: 1. Using iterative solution 2. Recursive solution


#Assignment 6:
Write a program that randomly generates an n x n adjacency matrix. The program print the adjacency matrix, the number of edges, and the degree in each vertex.
